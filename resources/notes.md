# How the project requirements listed below will be met.

## - What will the detailed form be used for? What other forms might you need?
    We could have a feedback form where people can leave feedback on our project or give ideas about it.
    Users can modify endings using the form. Once a user completes a story, they get a form popup and they can write in their endings and then their endings can be saved to the local storage.
## - What data would you need to store in Local storage for persistence?
    We can store the outcomes of a story and have that in the local storage like a throphy. e.g {Completed Obi Wan's Story}
## - What data will your app need? Is there an API or will you need to build your own dataset in a json file?
    We need two json data sets, containing the Starwars Jedi information, and an adventure story.
## - Where would it make sense to use a drop-down menu or modal?
    When a story has been completed, we can use a modal to display the final outcome of the story.
## - Where are opportunities to use CSS Animations?
    We can animate the containers of the characters to move up and down before they are selected.
    We can animate CYOA choices to ease into the screen or out of the screen.
